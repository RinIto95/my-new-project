# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Picking among favorite food is hard and balance the nutrients value of everyday meal is even more difficult, especially when you are on a diet. So this AI project would be about taking the preference of the users and nutrient value of the food and suggest a healthy meal.


## Background

Food is one of the most important thing in our life. However, it is so hard to think of what you are going to eat everyday, because:
we don't have time to think,
it is expensive,
some people want to lose weight.
But you still want to eat something that you like.
By using AI to understand the preference of the users and generate a list of dishes is probably possible and filter it again based on the nutrients value will give a healthy and tasty option for every meal.


## How is it used?

It probably is a solution for everyone, especially someone with limited time to consider and cooking their own meal. Users can use the suggestion as ease or change it to suit their preference even more, and if cooking is a problem, ordering the suggestion food is also a pretty good idea. Users must take into account that AI is not perfect and the suggestion may not be perfectly balance in nutrients or suit your preference.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
