# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Picking among favorite food is hard and balance the nutrients value of everyday meal is even more difficult, especially when you are on a diet. So this AI project would be about taking the preference of the users and nutrient value of the food and suggest a healthy meal.


## Background

Food is one of the most important thing in our life. However, it is so hard to think of what you are going to eat everyday, because:
we don't have time to think,
it is expensive,
some people want to lose weight.
But you still want to eat something that you like.
By using AI to understand the preference of the users and generate a list of dishes is probably possible and filter it again based on the nutrients value will give a healthy and tasty option for every meal.


## How is it used?

It probably is a solution for everyone, especially someone with limited time to consider and cooking their own meal. Users can use the suggestion as ease or change it to suit their preference even more, and if cooking is a problem, ordering the suggestion food is also a pretty good idea. Users must take into account that AI is not perfect and the suggestion may not be perfectly balance in nutrients or suit your preference.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data source: The data will be input by users when starting to use the service. 
The information about the nutrients value of each dish can be obtain through service like ReciPal API or Edamam Nutrition Analysis API. The recommendation balance diet can be obtain through Edamam Diet Recommendations API. AI Methods: since nutrients value and taste can be categories and turn to numerical value, Linear regression and Logistics regression could be enough but using neural network may give even better result.
## Challenges

When you try to lose weight with this AI, you may wonder what the beauty standards are, and it may effects your mental health.


## What next?
someone that is able to create AI system easily?
